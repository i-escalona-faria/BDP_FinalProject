# BDP_FinalProject
The following work contains the report, Jupyter Notebook, and all the associated files pertaining to the final project of Big Data Programming (CSC-4760) corresponding to the fall 2019 semester. Random Forest Classifier and Regressor were used with economic indicators data from the World Bank in order to predict the Human Development Index (HDI) for a country, as well as the GINI Coefficient. The accuracy of the models was were above 96% in all cases. This information can be used to help in reduce the dimensionality of the almost 1600 indicators, as well as discover factors that affect HDI and GINI Coefficient in order to focus efforts on these to improve these scores for under-performing countries.
